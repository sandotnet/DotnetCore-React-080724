    <h2>Early British colonialism in India</h2>
    <p>
        European traders first reached Indian shores with the arrival of the <strong>Portuguese</strong> explorer Vasco
        da Gama in 1498 at the port of Calicut, in search of the lucrative spice trade. <br>Just over a century later,
        the Dutch and English established trading outposts on the subcontinent, with the first English trading post set
        up at Surat in 1613.[3] Over the course of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the British[4]
        defeated the Portuguese and Dutch militarily, but remained in conflict with the French, who had by then sought
        to establish themselves in the subcontinent. The decline of the Mughal Empire in the first half of the
        eighteenth century provided the British with the opportunity to establish a firm foothold in Indian politics.

    <h3>Early rebellion</h3>
    <p>
        Puli Thevar was one of the opponents of the British rule in India. He was in conflict with the Nawab of Arcot
        who was supported by the British. His prominent exploits were his confrontations with Marudhanayagam, who later
        rebelled against the British in the late 1750s and early 1760s. Nelkatumseval the present Tirunelveli Dist of
        Tamil Nadu state of India was the headquarters of Puli Thevan.

        Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja was one of the earliest freedom fighters in India. He was the prince regent of the
        princely state of Kottiyur or Cotiote in North Malabar, near Kannur, India between 1774 and 1805. He fought a
        guerrilla war with tribal people from Wynad supporting him. He was caught by the British and his fort was razed
        to the ground.
