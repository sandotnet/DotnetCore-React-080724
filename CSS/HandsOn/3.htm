    <h1>Early British Colonialism in India</h1>
    <p id="p1">The first European to reach India via the Atlantic Ocean was the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, who
        reached
        Calicut in 1498 in search of spice.[2] Just over a century later, the Dutch and English established trading
        outposts on the Indian subcontinent, with the first English trading post set up at Surat in 1613.[3]</p>
    <p>
        Over the next two centuries, the British[note 1] defeated the Portuguese and Dutch but remained in conflict with
        the French. The decline of the Mughal Empire in the first half of the eighteenth century allowed the British to
        establish a foothold in Indian politics.[4] During the Battle of Plassey, the East India Company's Army defeated
        Siraj ud-Daulah, the Nawab of Bengal, and the company established itself as a major player in Indian affairs.
        After the Battle of Buxar of 1764, it gained administrative rights over Bengal, Bihar and the Midnapur part of
        Odisha.[5]
    </p>
    <h1>Early rebellions</h1>
    <p>After the defeat of Tipu Sultan, most of southern India came either under the company's direct rule, or under its
        indirect political control in a subsidiary alliance. The Company subsequently seized control of regions ruled by
        the Maratha Empire, after defeating them in a series of wars. Much of Punjab was annexed in 1849, after the
        defeat of Sikh armies in the First (1845–46) and Second (1848–49) Anglo-Sikh Wars.[6]</p>
